Load .txt file containing TileSet pathNames.

Load SpriteSheet and Sprite layout based on current pathName.
Start from TileSet 0.
Use this until another SpriteSheet is needed.
For each TileSprite in this set.
-Number of Sprites held - 1 byte (If 0, start next TileSet. If -1, start animations.)
-SpriteIDs - [Number of Sprites held * 2] bytes (& 0xFF)
-NormalMapIDs - [Number of Sprites held * 2] bytes (& 0xFF)
-Number of Sprite Indecies used - 1 byte (& 0xFF)
-Sprite Indecies - [Number of Sprite Indecies used] bytes, signed (if first value is -1, skip)
-Offsets - 3 * [Number of Sprite Indecies used] bytes, signed
-ShearTypes - [Number of Sprite Indecies used] bytes
-Shears - [Number of Sprite Indecies used] bytes
-Color R, G, B, A - 4 fixed point bytes. (& 0xFF) (if alpha is 0, skip)
-Emission - 1 fixed point byte (& 0xFF)
-MaterialID - 1 byte (& 0xFF)

Load TileAnimations.
-Number of TileSprites affected - 1 byte
-TileSpriteIDs - 2 bytes each (& 0xFFFF)
-Number of Frames - 1 byte (& 0xFF)
-Animation Type - 1 byte (if -1: AnimationID to get type and pointer from - 1 byte (& 0xFF).)
(if Animation type is SpriteCoord: -SpriteSlot - 1 byte, signed)
-For each frame:
--FrameTime - 4 fixed point bytes
--ActionID - 1 byte, signed
--Action parameters - depends on animation type and ActionID


In Level Editor
-Adding TileSets: Pull up red bar > Bottom option "Add New TileSet"
> Search for TileSet folder to add (should contain a SpriteSheet and SpriteLayout).
> Editor loads Sheet and Layout, creates Sprites with the layout,
   and creates a new tileSet associated with the Sheet.
> From the normal editor screen, pull up the red bar to change TileSets.

-Adding TileSprite: Click "Add TileSprite" (pulls up Sprites from current TileSet)
> Select Sprite > Select normal map > repeat for each sprite and normal map.
> Set sprite indecies.
> Set color.
> TileID is automatically assigned and a new TileSprite is created
   (Other TileIDs are shifted if needed)

-Adding TileAnimation.
>Pull out green bar > Select "Add Tile Animation".
?"Sprite Index", "Color", "Wrap", "Sprite Coord"
>Select a TileSprite to start.
>Start with one frame, set rate, actionType, and parameters for action.
>Select "+" to add a new frame.
>Select add TileSprites to select more TileSprites to add.
 (
    -If sprite index, can be bound to other index animations. Best practice is to not bind to multiple
     animations that can affect the same slot. Must have same number of Sprites indecies, must
     use the same index pointer, and must not be bound to a coord animation.
    -If color, must use the same color pointer and must not be bound to another color animation.
    -If wrap, can be bound to other wrap animations but must use the same wrap pointer.
    -If sprite coord, can be bound to other coord animations but must use the same Sprite pointer,
     must have the slot that the animation affects, and must not be bound to an index animation.

[If you want a TileSprite to use multiple effects, bind it to multiple TileAnimations.]
