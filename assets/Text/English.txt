#NOTES:
#-All commands are started with a "\". Use another one before it to use it as a character.
#-Lines that start with a "#" are a comment. Use a "\" before one to use it as a character.
#-Lines are assumed to start with a non-space character. To start a line with
# a space, use a "\" before one.
#-Newlines in this file after a "\." are asssumed to be text-clears between scrolls of text (\/).
#-String names use no tabs. String data is offset by one tab. This is how you seperate strings.
