Inspired by the Mega Man Zero series' EX Skills...
The Player can (or will be able to) earn advanced
Bomb Techniques when completing a planet with at
least an "A" ranking (on average or on planet I'm
not sure...)

If you fail to get at least an "A" ranking, you can
instead earn the EX technique from the Tower of
HardShip (or the Training Tower, whichever one it is)
